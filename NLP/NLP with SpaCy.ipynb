            "\"It was unfortunate,\" William went on, \"but it couldn't be helped. I am sure she was a very\n",
            "     good woman.\" (He said this with the more confidence because, from his childhood up, he had\n",

            "     the episode was over—but William was only beginning.\n",
            "\"I've been wondering,\" he said, \"what I should do—now that I'm independent. I don't want to\n",
            "     go on like this. It's a waste—when you've got money. But I don't know how to set about\n",

            "Faraday, raising his eyes from the ledger, met the wistful appeal in William's and imagined\n",

            "\"I see,\" he said interrogatively; \"then you haven't got your living to earn—you are not tied\n",

            "\"Yes,\" William assented, pleased with the phrase; \"I can direct my own life—certainly.\"\n",
            "\"Which,\" Faraday suggested, \"was difficult for you before?\"\n",
            "\"Very,\" said William emphatically.\n",

            "Faraday reflected with his chin resting on his hand.\n",
            "\"Why have you asked me?\" he demanded suddenly—with the accent strongly on the \"me.\"\n",
            "\"I know so few people,\" William explained humbly. \"I mean, of course, people who could give\n",
            "     me any ideas.... I thought you wouldn't mind—at least I hoped you wouldn't.... I know it's\n",
            "     unusual—but if you could help me in any way? ... With suggestions, you know.\"\n",
            "Again Faraday reflected with his chin resting on his hand.\n",
            "\"I could put you,\" he said at last, \"in touch with people who might help you. I should be\n",
            "     very pleased to do so.... Of course, I should like to know more of you first—what your views\n",
            "     are——\"\n",

            "\"If you've nothing else to do,\" Faraday continued, \"perhaps you'll come round to my rooms\n",

            "     while the world seethed in the melting-pot and the Kaiser battered at Liège.\n",
            "\"If it's fine,\" William cautioned again as they mounted the stairs to bed. \"I've heard\n",

            "William was sorry there wasn't—they had finished the last drop at lunch. Griselda sighed,\n",

            "     beyond the bend would have brought them to the outskirts of the village. Instead, they halted\n",
            "     and drew together for an instant; then one funny little thing, detaching himself from the\n",
            "     group, scampered backwards by the road he had come, and continued scampering till he rounded\n",
            "     the eastward bluff. His insects of companions remained grouped where he had left them, their\n",

            "What they had forgotten proved to be a column of horsemen curving in swift and orderly\n",

            "     the rhythmic, and he, like Griselda, bent forward to watch and to listen to the distant clatter\n",
            "     of hoofs echoed back from the walls of the valley. As the horsemen swung out of sight round the\n",
            "     westward bluff and the clatter of hoof-beats deadened, he held up a finger, and Griselda asked,\n",
            "     \"What is it?\"\n",
            "\"Guns,\" he said. \"Cannon—don't you hear them?\"\n",
            "She did; a soft, not unpleasing thud, repeated again and again, and coming down the breeze\n",
            "     from the northward.\n",

            "\"They're pretending to fight in the village,\" Griselda said. \"How silly! Firing off guns and\n",
            "     making believe to shoot people.\"\n",
            "\"Militarism,\" William assented, \"is always silly.\" And he, in his turn, enlarged on his\n",
            "     favourite text, the impossibility of international warfare, owing to the ever-growing\n",
            "     solidarity of the European working-classes—his little homily being punctuated here and there by\n",
            "     a further crackle from below. When he had enlarged sufficiently and Griselda had duly agreed,\n",
            "     he returned as it were to private life and suggested:\n",

            "     in sight they were both thirsty, and secretly relieved that their last excursion was over.\n",
            "\"We'll put on the spirit-lamp and have some tea,\" Griselda announced as they pushed open the\n",
